# Cognitive Car Insurance Claims

This lab takes you through developing a cognitive car insurance claims form
that can identify problems with claims automatically before they reach the
processing queue, providing instant feedback for the customer and lowing
overall workload.

It uses IBM Cloud Pak for Integration and Watson services.
